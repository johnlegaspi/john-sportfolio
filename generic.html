								<p> I have emceed in my church for a couple of times. The image above is the most recent one. This opportunity given to me was one of the factors that sparked my interest. Speaking to a crowd and having the attention all on you enraptures me. As an emcee, I like to think of myself as the gateway to all speakers, entertainers and performers. This is because I would have to make a proper and intriguing introduction for them before they speak or perform their act. I would say that I also have a pretty good sense of humour, and my subtle jokes, while I speak, can keep the people viewing entertained. As an emcee, I am also the one that directs the atmosphere of the event, this means that I have to be engaging to keep the people excited and intrigued. These are the few things that have further developed my interest in the industry. I still do have many flaws and rough edges, that I wish to improve. And with the help of the course, I believe that I can further develop and enhance my skills and also be more professional. Having a passion for this course, I will work hard to attain my goal is to be in the media industry of Singapore and also hopefully revolutionise it.  </p>
